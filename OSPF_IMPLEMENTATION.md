# OSPF Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation replaces the RIP (Routing Information Protocol) with OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) in the router codebase. OSPF is a link-state routing protocol that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path tree.

## Key Components

### 1. OSPF Protocol Structures (sr_protocol.h)
- **sr_ospf_hdr**: Common OSPF header with version, type, router ID, area ID, and checksum
- **sr_ospf_hello**: Hello packet for neighbor discovery with Hello interval, dead interval
- **sr_ospf_lsa**: Link State Advertisement containing router ID, subnet, mask, sequence number
- **sr_ospf_lsu**: Link State Update packet containing multiple LSAs

### 2. OSPF Data Structures (sr_ospf.h)
- **sr_ospf_neighbor**: Neighbor table entry with router ID, IP address, interface, last Hello time, and alive status
- **sr_ospf_lsdb_entry**: Link State Database entry with router ID, subnet, mask, sequence number, timestamp, and age
- **sr_ospf_instance**: Global OSPF instance containing router ID, area ID, sequence number, neighbors list, and LSDB

### 3. Core OSPF Functions (sr_ospf.c)

#### Neighbor Discovery
- `sr_ospf_send_hello()`: Sends Hello packets on all interfaces every 5 seconds
- `sr_ospf_handle_hello()`: Processes received Hello packets and updates neighbor table
- `sr_ospf_check_neighbors()`: Checks for neighbor timeouts (20 second dead interval)

#### Link State Database Management
- `sr_ospf_generate_lsa()`: Generates LSAs for directly connected networks
- `sr_ospf_flood_lsa()`: Floods LSAs to all neighbors
- `sr_ospf_handle_lsu()`: Processes received Link State Updates
- `sr_ospf_update_lsdb()`: Updates LSDB with new LSAs
- `sr_ospf_age_lsdb()`: Ages and removes expired LSAs (20 second max age)

#### Routing Table Computation
- `sr_ospf_run_spf()`: Runs Dijkstra's SPF algorithm (simplified implementation)
- `sr_ospf_update_routing_table()`: Updates routing table based on LSDB and SPF results

### 4. Integration Changes

#### sr_router.c
- Added OSPF initialization in `sr_init()`
- Replaced RIP timeout thread with OSPF timeout thread
- Updated IP packet handling to process OSPF packets (protocol 89)
- OSPF packets are identified by `ip_protocol_ospf` in the IP header
- Hello packets trigger neighbor discovery
- LSU packets trigger LSDB updates

#### sr_rt.c
- Disabled RIP functions (wrapped in `#if 0`)
- Original RIP timeout, request, response, and update functions are no longer used

#### sr_vns_comm.c
- Removed `send_rip_request()` call during initialization
- OSPF uses Hello packets for neighbor discovery instead

## OSPF Operation Flow

### Initialization
1. Router starts and initializes OSPF instance with router ID (IP of first interface)
2. OSPF timeout thread starts
3. Routing table is populated with directly connected networks

### Neighbor Discovery
1. Every 5 seconds, router sends Hello packets on all interfaces
2. When a Hello packet is received:
   - Extract neighbor router ID and IP address
   - Add or update neighbor in neighbor table
   - Update last Hello timestamp
3. Check for neighbor timeouts every 5 seconds
   - If no Hello received for 20 seconds, mark neighbor as down

### Link State Advertisement
1. Generate LSAs for all directly connected networks
2. Each LSA contains:
   - Router ID (originating router)
   - Subnet and mask
   - Sequence number (incrementing)
   - Age (0 for new LSAs)
3. Flood LSAs to all neighbors via Link State Update packets
4. When LSU is received:
   - Process each LSA
   - Update LSDB if LSA is newer (higher sequence number)
5. Age LSAs periodically
   - Remove LSAs older than 20 seconds

### Routing Table Computation
1. Run SPF calculation (simplified)
2. Update routing table:
   - Add directly connected networks (metric 0)
   - Add routes learned from neighbors (metric 1)
   - Routes to networks advertised by alive neighbors
   - Gateway is the neighbor's IP address
3. Remove invalid routes (neighbors that are down)

## Timers
- **Hello Interval**: 5 seconds
- **Dead Interval**: 20 seconds
- **LSA Refresh**: 5 seconds
- **LSA MaxAge**: 20 seconds

## Differences from Full OSPF
This is a simplified OSPF implementation suitable for the lab environment:
- Single area only (backbone area 0)
- No authentication
- Simplified SPF (direct neighbor routes only, not full graph-based Dijkstra)
- No Designated Router (DR) or Backup Designated Router (BDR)
- No multiple link types (all links treated as point-to-point)
- No external route redistribution
- Uses broadcast instead of multicast (simplified for lab)

## Testing
The implementation should support:
- Network topology discovery through Hello packets
- Route propagation through LSA flooding
- Routing table convergence
- Link failure detection and recovery
- Multi-hop routing through neighbors

The existing test cases from the RIP implementation should work with OSPF, as they test:
- Basic connectivity (ping, traceroute)
- Link failures
- Route convergence after topology changes
